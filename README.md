## Design
<hr>

### Design decisions
This project has been crafted to appeal to a diverse range of clients and potential users, featuring a minimalist white background complemented by striking, high-quality images of architectural designs and structures. This visually engaging and attractive approach aims to capture attention and interest.





### Wireframes

***

- [Mobile-wireframes(pdf)](docs/wireframes/mobile_wireframes.pdf)
- [Tablet-wireframes(pdf)](docs/wireframes/tablet_wireframes.pdf)
- [Desktop-wireframes(pdf)](docs/wireframes/desktop_wireframes.pdf)


### Colour
A minimalist colour palette that gives the website a bright and uncluttered appearance.







![Color](docs/features/color_pallete.png)

### Fonts

Google fonts are used as follows:


- The website primarily employs the Oswald sans-serif font, which is integrated into the CSS file using the @import method. However, to enhance site performance, we opt to download it and link it through @font-face class. This font was selected for its compatibility with web body text, ensuring readability even at small sizes.

![ font Oswald sans-serif](docs/features/font_oswald_sans-serif.jpg)

- The contact form utilizes the Font Awesome 6, which has been imported into the html through java-script. This font family was chosen for its excellent readability.

![ Font Awesome 6](docs/features/font_awesome_6-1.jpg)
![ Font Awesome 6](docs/features/font_awesome_6-2.jpg)


### Structure

The website is designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and familiar, structured as a single landing page segmented into distinct sections. Navigation is tailored separately for mobile and desktop screens, following standard industry practices. The website is divided into six separate sections as follows:

- Main Section: This is the idol section with an engaging image, dual navigation tailored to screen size, a welcoming introduction, and a brief overview of the architectural firm.

- Projects Section: Showcasing three different types of architectural services or projects for clients to explore.

- Portfolio Section: A carousel feature displaying a selection of the firm's past architectural projects.

- Gallery Section: Images that highlight the firm's architectural achievements and project snapshots.

- About Us Section: Detailed information about the architectural company, its history, and philosophy.

- Two distinct navigation types (for mobile and desktop):
- Both navigation systems are user-friendly, intuitive, and adaptable to all screen sizes. They feature a hamburger menu for mobile devices and screens up to 768px, and a sticky navigation bar for screens larger than 768px. This setup, with links to specific sections, offers users a clear and straightforward way to navigate the website. For the desktop version, the links are underlined and increase in size upon hover, enhancing user interaction.
