## Design
<hr>

- [Desktop-wireframes(pdf)](docs/wireframes/desktop_wireframes.pdf)


### Colour
A minimalist colour palette that gives the website a bright and uncluttered appearance.







![Color](docs/features/color_pallete.png)

### Fonts

Google fonts are used as follows:


- The website primarily employs the Oswald sans-serif font, which is integrated into the CSS file using the @import method. However, to enhance site performance, we opt to download it and link it through @font-face class. This font was selected for its compatibility with web body text, ensuring readability even at small sizes.

![ font Oswald sans-serif](docs/features/font_oswald_sans-serif.jpg)

- The contact form utilizes the Font Awesome 6, which has been imported into the html through java-script. This font family was chosen for its excellent readability.

### Structure

The website is designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and familiar, structured as a single landing page segmented into distinct sections. Navigation is tailored separately for mobile and desktop screens, following standard industry practices. The website is divided into six separate sections as follows:

- Main Section: This is the idol section with an engaging image, dual navigation tailored to screen size, a welcoming introduction, and a brief overview of the architectural firm.

- Projects Section: Showcasing three different types of architectural services or projects for clients to explore.
